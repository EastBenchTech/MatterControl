A magnetic base with interchangeable build plates is easily one of the most accessible upgrades makers can install on their 3D printer. With LayerLock MagBase, simply adhere it to your bare print bed, attach any magnetic build plate to it, adjust your z-height and you're ready to reap all the beneficial perks! No more struggling to scrape off prints at awkward angles or in restricted spaces&mdash;detach the plate from the magnetic base and pop your print off with a simple bend. Want to reduce the amount of time spent between removing a part and starting your next print? Simply take off the current build surface that's magnetically attached and throw on a spare plate for seamless production. Not interested in being tied down to one type of build surface? Switch between any surface that can be attached to a plate such as powder coated PEI, garolite and even glass thanks to LayerLock MagBase's diverse compatibility. The benefits of a magnetic base with detachable build plates are so popular that some 3D printers such as the <a title=\"Pulse 3D Printers\" href=\"https://www.matterhackers.com/store/c/Pulse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pulse</a> offer options for a pre-installed magnetic base on the print bed. Install LayerLock MagBase on your 3D printer and experience the invaluable convenience for yourself.</p>",

This product is sold as a magnetic base alone so users may choose to mix and match what types and how many different types of build surfaces they would prefer to make with their purchase. Every maker from beginners to veterans has a unique 3D printing experience which is why LayerLock MagBase offers flexibility in build surface options. Only want a powder coated PEI build plate? How about all the different surfaces currently listed in the add-ons? Maybe you already have a build plate and don't need an add-on? Whatever your reason, LayerLock MagBase offers flexibility for every maker's individual needs.</p>",

If using acetone to remove the leftover adhesive, make sure the acetone is only used on the areas with adhesive still attached. Place the LayerLock MagBase on the print bed (with the adhesive liner still attached) and confirm you are satisfied with the placement before attempting attachment. Remove the adhesive half way and carefully stick the exposed side onto the print bed, making sure to align it parallel with the print bed. Slowly and firmly smooth the rest of the magnetic sheet onto the bed with your hand from one side to the other, making sure to leave no air bubbles underneath. If you do find air bubbles under the sheet, make sure to use a credit card to push the air bubbles out towards the nearest corner/side. Once your base is attached, put on a build plate and level your bed either through the printer or software. Now you are ready to print!</p>",
